# Assignment 1

>Note: I'm using vim rather than emacs for the following Labs/Homework.

For grading conveniece purposeses the './simulate' script can be called to run the vim commands that I recorded. 
This will download the necessary files and output the resulting edits/diffs to the scratchwork directory.
The scratchworkbk directory contains the results of my manual edits; these should be the same as the output of the given script.

All vim motions and answers for the labs are documented in markdown files in the notes directory.
You can also view the viminfo files in the vimscriptbk directory for the exact commands that are run on said html files.

The c file and its resulting binary are in the junk folder along with their outputs.

The myspell script is in the spellscript directory along with the sorted.words dictionary file.
